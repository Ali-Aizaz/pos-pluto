## Tools and Techniques

- **Next.js:** This project is built using Next.js, a popular React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes. Next.js allows for fast and dynamic web pages, making it an ideal choice for web development projects.
- **Tailwind CSS:** This project uses Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for easy customization of your website's appearance. Tailwind CSS provides a wide range of pre-built classes that can be used to quickly style your website.
- **React Hook Form:** This project uses React Hook Form, a lightweight and performant library for handling forms in React applications. React Hook Form provides an easy-to-use API for managing form state, validation, and submission.
- **Prettier:** This project uses Prettier, an opinionated code formatter that ensures consistent code style across your project. Prettier automatically formats your code according to a set of rules, making it easier to read and maintain.
- **Yup:** This project uses Yup, a JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation. Yup allows you to define complex validation rules for your forms and ensures that user input is valid before submitting it to your server.
